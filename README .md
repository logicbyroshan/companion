# Companion 🚀

Companion is a next-gen platform for developers and students to **showcase real skills** through verified projects, experiences, and education — not fake resumes.

> Think of it as a blend of GitHub + LinkedIn, but purely built for **developers**, **students**, and **recruiters** to connect through _trust_, _proof_, and _community_.
